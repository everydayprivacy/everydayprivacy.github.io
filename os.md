## Operating Systems

Use Fedora.

Do not use Windows 10.

Comments

* There will be a few things that must be done on Windows, and that's fine.  Use Windows for those things.  But you may find that most routine activities can be Linux.

* The recommendation here is really "Use Linux", and is not actually specific to Fedora.  The archives of the internet are filled with debates about which Linux distribution is the best.  We do not take a position on any of that, other than:  Any Linux distribution is better than Windows 10.  Pick one of them, and go with it.  The idea with the "Use Fedora" is to suggest one for those who don't have any prior knowledge of Linux.

In the same spirit of suggesting something for those with no background in the various Linux desktop environments, we'll simplify that as well by saying this:

Use the [Xfce Desktop Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfce).

### Procedure

This is a good point to mention that DuckDuckGo will be your best friend as you work through the details of installing Fedora on your laptop or desktop machine.  This section provides a very broad sketch of the steps involved.  There are countless resources on the internet to assist you on your journey.

1. Download the pre-build ISO file from [here](https://spins.fedoraproject.org/en/xfce/).

2. Copy the ISO to a USB drive.

3. Boot from the USB drive on the machine you want to install Fedora on.

4. After booting from the USB, there will be an icon on the desktop for installing Fedora on the disk drive.  Double-click it.

5. Proceed through the wizard for installing Fedora on the disk drive.

6. Remove the USB drive.  Reboot.

7. Change your Firefox settings according to [our recommendations](browser.md).
