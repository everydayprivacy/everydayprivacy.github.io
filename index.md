## Everyday Privacy

If you...

* **care about your privacy** and protecting your personal information while online, but don't know what to do

* are intimidated by the constant barrage of security breaches and compromises, leaving you feeling like the problem is too big and there is nothing you can do about it

* have the impression that only those who are technically-savvy can do anything to protect their personal privacy

...then this site is for you.

It is understandable to feel like it's all out of our control.  There are no private sector companies nor government agencies motivated to help with this.  Indeed, they are motivated to do just the opposite: to collect as much of your personal information as possible while hiding that data collection from you.

**There are things you can do**.  Simple things.  Effective things.

That's what this site is about.  This site is for those who:

* do not work with computers and technology as a profession or serious hobby

* already care about their personal privacy

* want to know what they can do to protect their privacy

* do not want a bunch of hype, [clickbait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait), or [FUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt)

It's important to point out [what this site is not](scope.md).  It is not going to suggest solutions for every potential risk to your privacy.  Some risks are not significant nor actionable for the average person.  Nor will we be comprehensive.  There are lots of ways to address the risks discussed on this site.  People should use whatever techniques they are comfortable with.  More on our scope can be found [here](scope.md).

The approach we take is:

1. Identify the important [risks](risks.md)

    Those things that expose the most personal information while doing routine online activities

2. Present a single [solution](risks.md) for dealing with each of those [risks](risks.md)

We will take **a balanced approach** in suggesting solutions.  Balanced means doing things that will be effective, and at the same time minimizing any impact on usability and convenience.  This _is_ possible, and is one of the central messages of this site.

One thing to say up front, is that there does exist a minimum level of technical knowledge required to accomplish these goals.  The technology ecosystem right now does not support the notion that individuals with zero technical knowledge can protect their online privacy.  This is unfortunate, and something we should strive to change, but that's where things are right now.  But the level of technical knowledge needed is far lower than what most people think, which is the other central message of this site.

If you're not sure where to start, scan through the [Risks & Solutions](risks.md) and then proceed to our [Getting Started](gettingstarted.md) page.
