## Applications

The software applications that you choose to use are responsible for a large amount of the collection of your personal information without your permission.

* Regarding "without your permission", here's the thing:  Nobody makes decisions to use or not use software based on the [EULA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-user_license_agreement), and nobody carefully considers whether to allow or deny permissions when installing Apps on their smartphone.  EULAs and phone permissions are not reasonable nor effective.  They're just [CYA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_your_ass) for lawyers.

The list of apps on this page will never be comprehensive, as that is obviously impossible to do.  We provide guidelines for some of the more egregious cases, but ultimately everyone needs to make their own assessment of the tradeoffs involved and make their own decisions on whether to use an app or not.

### Social Networks

Sites like Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc., are well-known for collecting, aggregating, monetizing, and selling your personal information.

That is _precisely_ their business model.  That's what they do.  It's interwoven into the very fabric of those businesses.

Saying that you aren't aware that Facebook does this is like saying you didn't know cigarettes cause cancer.

You stopped smoking, didn't you?  You can do the same with these social networks.

### Payment Processors

* PayPal

    Do not use [PayPal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal).  You're sharing your purchase history with a third party who is going aggregate it with other information about you and monetize it.  Use your credit card instead ($50 liability limit, but even that $50 is usually waived).

* Square point-of-sale devices

    Do not use credit/debit cards at merchants who use [Square devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square,_Inc.) as their cash register.  You're sharing your purchase history with a third party who is going aggregate it with other information about you and monetize it.  Use cash for your cafe au lait.

### Messaging and Chat

Use [Signal](https://www.signal.org/) for text messaging, voice chat, and video chat.

The "do not use" list:

* Do not use [Telegram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(software))

* Do not use [WhatsApp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp)

* Do not use Apps that exchange data via [SMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS).

### Zoom Video Conferencing

Do not use [Zoom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_Video_Communications)
