* Despite the wording above, these recommendations should not be seen as absolutes, but should reflect your normal habits.  Most of the time, use DuckDuckGo.  Set DuckDuckGo as [the default search engine in Firefox](browser.md).

* We provide rationale on the [email page](email.md) about why Google should be avoided as your email provider.  The same logic applies here.
