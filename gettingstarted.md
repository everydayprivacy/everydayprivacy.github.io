## Getting Started

The main idea with this site, which is reflected in its structure, is that you can peruse the various ideas presented, and cherry pick whatever suggestions are appealing to you, if any, and do those things.

But it's also ok if you just don't know where to start.

If you're someone who uses a Windows machine and your cellphone, basically by default, for the majority of your online activities, we'd suggest the following sequence of actions for your consideration:

1. Switch to using Firefox, with the settings we suggest.  See [browser](browser.md).

1. Use the DuckDuckGo search engine for the majority of your searches.  See [search](search.md).

1. Review the applications you use on your Windows machine and/or phone and discontinue using those that collect your personal information without your permission.  See [applications](applications.md).

1. Start minimizing your use of your cellphone for sensitive activities, like online banking.

1. If you are using Gmail or another free email provider, switch to a paid service.  See [email](email.md).

1. Start using a password manager if you are not already.  See [password](password.md).

1. Buy a middle-of-the-road laptop or desktop system to be your Linux machine.

    You'll become a two-computer person if you just have a single Windows machine now.  Ebay can be useful for getting a used or refurbished machine for this.  Keep in mind you don't care about the OS or any software that comes on the hardware.  You'll be wiping the hard drive and installing Linux on it.  With two machines, you can take your time and transition your online activities to your Linux machine on your own schedule, while retaining your Windows machine for those activities that are required to be on Windows.

1.  After acquiring the laptop or desktop, proceed with installation and configuration.  See [os](os.md).
