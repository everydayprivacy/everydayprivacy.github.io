## Passwords

Do not use the same password on more than one website.

Make your passwords 8 to 10 random characters.

Use [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/)

Comments

* The recommendation here is really "use a password manager".  Pick any password manager that you believe to be trustworthy.  There are several good ones available.

* Passwords longer than 10 (assuming they are random characters) do not help enough to be worth it.

    There is plenty of additional commentary possible about this bullet point.  The main thing is that we are not trying to guard against offline attacks (where the attacker has acquired a copy of the hashed password file).  Our goal is to adequately mitigate an online attack.  For that, we consider 8-10 random characters to be sufficient.
