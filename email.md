## Email

Do not use Gmail.

Google reads your email.

It really is that simple.

Gmail is not free.  You are handing over to google information about you that is worth far more than the value of the service you receive from them.

There are lots of email providers to pick from.  A random sampling includes:

* [Fastmail.com](https://www.fastmail.com/)

* [ProtonMail.com](https://www.protonmail.com/)

* [Mailbox.org](https://mailbox.org/)

There are many, many others to pick from.

Pick one of them.

We sometimes get feedback along the lines of not wanting to pay for email or it being too hard to switch email providers.  We do understand the level of effort involved in switching email providers.  The cost of many good email providers is around $5 USD per month.

The premise of this site is about preventing third parties from collecting the personal details of your life and then monetizing it.  Use of Gmail means sending the personal details of your life directly to Google.  These things are mutually exclusive.  It really is that simple.
