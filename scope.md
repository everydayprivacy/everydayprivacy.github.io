## Scope

What this site is and isn't about

### What this site is about

The [home page](index.md) covers the goals of this site

### What this site is _not_ about

* This site is not trying to convince anyone to care about privacy

    We assume the reader already cares.  Convincing those who are not concerned about their online privacy is a critically important activity.  It's just not what this site is about.

* This is not a HOW-TO site

    We do include some useful links as a convenience and as a starting point, but a good search engine will be an invaluable resource to suppliment the information here.

* We do not attempt to cover every possible risk nor every possible solution

    As mentioned on the [home page](index.md), we intentionally ignore non-typical risks or complex solutions.  We strive for everything here to be accessible and relevant to the most common ways in which personal information gets collected without permission.

*  We do not cover techniques to hide from determined attackers who are focusing on you specifically.  In other words, if you're a target of an [APT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat/), you are a special case not covered in these web pages.
