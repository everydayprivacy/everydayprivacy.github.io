## Mobile Phones

This is a tough area to address from a privacy perspective.

We have come to rely on phones for so many things, and yet, the reality is that these devices and the Apps that run on them cannot be trusted with our personal information.

The general recommendations are:

* Minimize the use of your smartphone to the extent possible

* Minimize the use of SMS text messaging to the extent possible

    The qualifier "SMS" is important.  [SMS messages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS) are not private.  See [Messaging and Chat Applications](applications.md#messaging-and-chat) for more information on how to exchange messages with friends and family.

* Do not do banking and other sensitive activities on your phone

* Do not use mobile phone apps that are known to collect your personal information.  See [Applications](applications.md).

### Location Data

The wireless providers track your location at all times, and sell that data to a variety of third parties.

The problem is that cellular phones cannot function without being in contact with the cellular network.

Airplane mode is an option to prevent location tracking, but it's not reasonable to be constantly turning on and off Airplane mode.

Probably the only real solution for addressing mobile phone privacy issues is through new laws and regulations.  Email your representatives in Congress.  Donate to privacy advocacy organizations.
